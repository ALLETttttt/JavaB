# Course on Java back-end developer from JAVAT
Hi, my name is **Temirlan**. This course is created for those who want to learn programming in **Java**,
but don't know anything about programming yet.

## About me
I am a developer with experience in IT and teaching beginner programmers. Want to learn more about me or get in touch
directly for mentorship or partnership? Visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/temirlan100).

## Why Java?
Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used in many projects of different
scale - from mobile applications to large corporate systems. Java allows you to develop solutions for various
domains: finance, medicine, games, science and many others. Learning Java will open doors to the fascinating world of IT
and many exciting opportunities

## Course Benefits
