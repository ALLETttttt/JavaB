### Title: Telemedicine System
### Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a Telemedicine System using Java and Spring technologies. 
The system will facilitate online consultations, manage patient health records, handle prescription management, 
and provide a platform for doctors and patients to communicate.

#### Business Case:
Telemedicine is transforming the healthcare industry by making healthcare more accessible and efficient. 
This project will allow developers to understand and implement essential features of telemedicine systems, 
emphasizing security, data integrity, and user interaction.

#### Suggested Architecture & Database Description:
- **Database Schema:**
    - **Patients**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `medical_history`
    - **Doctors**: `id`, `name`, `specialization`, `schedule`
    - **Appointments**: `id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `date`, `time`, `status`
    - **Prescriptions**: `id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `medication`, `dosage`, `duration`
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Security**: Spring Security for authentication and securing endpoints
- **Data Handling**: Spring Data JPA for data management
- **API**: RESTful services using Spring Web for data processing

### User Stories:
1. **As a patient, I want to:**
    - Register and log in to the system.
    - View available doctors and their schedules.
    - Book an online consultation.
    - Communicate with the doctor during the consultation.
    - Receive prescriptions from the doctor.
    - View my medical records and prescriptions.
2. **As a doctor, I want to:**
    - Log in to the system.
    - View my schedule.
    - Conduct online consultations with patients.
    - View patient medical history before a consultation.
    - Write prescriptions during or after a consultation.
    - Update patient medical records after a consultation.
3. **As a system, I need to:**
    - Validate user credentials.
    - Handle sessions to ensure that users' operations are secure and personal information is protected.
    - Process appointments accurately and securely, updating schedules in real-time.
    - Provide timely feedback to the user about the status of their appointments and prescriptions.

### API Requirements:
- **Authentication and Session Management:**
    - `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
    - `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate user and create a session.
    - `POST /auth/logout`: Terminate the session.
- **Appointment Operations:**
    - `GET /doctors`: List all doctors and their schedules.
    - `POST /appointments`: Book a new online consultation.
    - `PUT /appointments/{id}`: Reschedule an existing consultation.
    - `DELETE /appointments/{id}`: Cancel a consultation.
    - `GET /appointments`: View consultation history.
- **Medical Records and Prescriptions:**
    - `GET /patients/{id}/records`: View patient's medical records.
    - `PUT /patients/{id}/records`: Update patient's medical records.
    - `GET /patients/{id}/prescriptions`: View patient's prescriptions.
    - `POST /patients/{id}/prescriptions`: Create a new prescription.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Spring Boot Application Setup:**
    - Properly configure and initialize a Spring Boot application using Gradle as the build tool. Include dependencies for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring Web.
2. **Database and Entity Configuration:**
    - Define JPA entities corresponding to the database schema for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, and Prescriptions.
    - Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure Spring Data JPA to interact with it.
    - Create repositories for each entity with necessary custom methods to support CRUD operations beyond the basic functionalities provided by Spring Data.
3. **User Authentication:**
    - Implement a secure login system that authenticates users by email and password.
    - Ensure that all operations require user authentication.
    - Sessions must expire automatically after a period of inactivity or explicitly upon user logout.
4. **Appointment and Prescription Processing:**
    - Develop endpoints to handle booking, rescheduling, and cancelling consultations. These must update and fetch schedules accurately.
    - Implement a system that allows doctors to view and update patient medical records and write prescriptions.
    - All operations must handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages to the user.
5. **API Documentation:**
    - Set up Swagger for API documentation.
    - Document all API endpoints with Swagger, including all request and response models, expected error messages, and status codes.
    - Ensure that the Swagger UI is accessible and correctly displays all API endpoints.
6. **Testing:**
    - Write integration tests for all critical functionalities such as login, booking, rescheduling, cancelling consultations, and managing prescriptions.
