## 1. Data Types
In Java, data types determine the kind of values a variable can hold. They are categorized into 
two main groups: **Primitive Data Types** and **Reference Data Types**.

### 1.1. Primitive Data Types
These are the most basic data types available within the Java language. They include:
- **byte**: 8-bit signed two's complement integer (range: -128 to 127)
- **short**: 16-bit signed two's complement integer (range: -32,768 to 32,767)
- **int**: 32-bit signed two's complement integer (range: -2^31 to 2^31 -1)
- **long**: 64-bit signed two's complement integer (range: -2^63 to 2^63 -1)
- **float**: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
- **double**: 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
- **char**: 16-bit Unicode character (range: 0 to 65,535)
- **boolean**: Represents only two possible values, `true` and `false`.

```java
int age = 25;
double salary = 1000.50;
char initial = 'A';
boolean isStudent = true;
```

### 1.2. Reference Data Types
Reference data types are used to store references to objects. The default value of 
a reference variable is `null`. Some examples are:
- **Arrays**
- **Classes**
- **Interfaces**

Java provides built-in reference types like `String` which is actually a class, but it's used so frequently that it feels like a basic data type.

```java
String name = "John";
String[] names = {"John", "Doe", "Jane"};
```

## 2. Operators
Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands and then return a result.

### 2.1. Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description             | Example   |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| +        | Addition                | a + b     |
| -        | Subtraction             | a - b     |
| *        | Multiplication          | a * b     |
| /        | Division                | a / b     |
| %        | Modulus (remainder)     | a % b     |

### 2.2. Relational Operators
| Operator | Description             | Example   |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| ==       | Equal to                | a == b    |
| !=       | Not equal to            | a != b    |
| >        | Greater than            | a > b     |
| <        | Less than               | a < b     |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to| a >= b    |
| <=       | Less than or equal to   | a <= b    |

### 2.3. Logical Operators
| Operator | Description             | Example     |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| &&       | Logical AND             | a && b      |
| \|\|     | Logical OR              | a \|\| b    |
| !        | Logical NOT             | !a          |

### 2.4. Other Important Operators
- **Assignment Operators** (like `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`)
- **Bitwise Operators** (like `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, and `>>>`)

```java
int result = (10 > 5) ? 1 : 0; // result will be 1
```


## 3. Casting in Java
In Java, casting is the process of converting one data type to another. There are two types of casting:
1. **Implicit Casting** (Widening Conversion)
2. **Explicit Casting** (Narrowing Conversion)

### 3.1 Implicit Casting
Java automatically promotes one data type to another without any explicit request from the user. This usually occurs when converting from a smaller type to a larger type.

**Example**:
```java
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double
```

**Order of Implicit Casting**:
```
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
```

### 3.2 Explicit Casting
When you're trying to assign a value from a larger type to a smaller type, you must perform an explicit cast. Be cautious, as explicit casting might cause data loss if the value doesn't fit within the target type's range.

**Syntax**:
```java
(targetType) value
```

**Example**:
```java
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Explicit casting: double to int
```

### Considerations with Casting
- **Data Loss**: Narrowing conversion (explicit casting) can lead to data loss. For instance, when you cast a `double` to an `int`, you lose the decimal part.
- **Rounding**: Java does not round numbers when you explicitly cast. It truncates the decimal part. For example, casting 9.99 to an `int` gives you 9, not 10.
- **OutOfRange**: Casting can lead to out-of-range values. Casting a large `int` value into a `byte` might result in unexpected values due to byte wrapping.
- **Class Casting**: Apart from primitive types, you can cast objects in Java. However, this involves rules of polymorphism and requires understanding of the class hierarchy. Attempting to cast unrelated classes will result in a runtime exception.

## **General hints for Students:**  
1. Use the `Scanner` class for input.
2. Use `System.out.printf()` to control the precision of the output to two decimal places.
### **Example:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CircleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to get user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle
        System.out.print("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
        double radius = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        // Calculate the area and circumference
        double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
        double circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
        
        // Output the results with precision of two decimal places
        System.out.printf("The area of the circle with radius %.2f is %.2f\n", radius, area);
        System.out.printf("The circumference of the circle with radius %.2f is %.2f\n", radius, circumference);
        
        // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. We imported the `Scanner` class for input.
2. We used the `System.out.printf()` method to display the results with a precision of two decimal places.
3. In the `printf` statements, the `%f` format specifier is used for floating-point numbers, and the `.2` before the `f` sets the precision to two decimal places.
4. The program prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle, calculates the area and circumference based on the given radius, and then outputs the results with two decimal places.
