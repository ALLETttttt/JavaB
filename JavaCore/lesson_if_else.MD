## **If-Else Operator in Java**

### **1. Introduction**
The `if-else` construct in Java is used to perform conditional operations, i.e., it lets you execute a block of code only if a particular condition is `true` and optionally another block of code if the condition is `false`.

### **2. Syntax**
```java  
if (condition) {  
    // code to be executed if condition is true  
} else {  
    // code to be executed if condition is false  
}  
```  

**Note**: The `else` block is optional.
### **3. Simple Examples**

**Example 1**: Check if a number is positive
```java  
int number = 5;  
  
if (number > 0) {  
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");  
} else {  
    System.out.println("The number is not positive.");  
}  
```  
**Output**:
```  
The number is positive.  
```  

**Example 2**: Decide if one should wear a jacket based on temperature
```java  
int temperature = 15;  // in Celsius  
  
if (temperature < 20) {  
    System.out.println("Wear a jacket.");  
} else {  
    System.out.println("No jacket needed.");  
}  
```  
**Output**:
```  
Wear a jacket.  
```  

### **4. Nested If-Else**
You can have an `if-else` inside another `if-else`. This is called nested if-else.  
**Syntax**:
```java  
if (condition1) {  
    // code  
} else if (condition2) {  
    // code  
} else {  
    // code  
}  
```  

**Example**: Classify a given number
```java  
int num = 0;  
  
if (num > 0) {  
    System.out.println("Positive number.");  
} else if (num < 0) {  
    System.out.println("Negative number.");  
} else {  
    System.out.println("Zero.");  
}  
```  
**Output**:
```  
Zero.  
```  

### **5. Using Logical Operators**
Java provides three main logical operators:
- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT

These can be used to combine or modify conditions in `if-else` constructs.

#### **5.1 Logical AND (`&&`)**
It checks two conditions and returns `true` only if both conditions are `true`.

**Example**: Check if a number is both positive and even.
```java  
int number = 6;  
  
if (number > 0 && number % 2 == 0) {  
    System.out.println("The number is positive and even.");  
} else {  
    System.out.println("The number does not meet the criteria.");  
}  
```  
**Output**:
```  
The number is positive and even.  
```  

#### **5.2 Logical OR (`||`)**
It checks two conditions and returns `true` if at least one of the conditions is `true`.

**Example**: Check if a number is either negative or odd.
```java  
int number = 7;  
  
if (number < 0 || number % 2 != 0) {  
    System.out.println("The number is either negative or odd.");  
} else {  
    System.out.println("The number is positive and even.");  
}  
```  
**Output**:
```  
The number is either negative or odd.  
```  

#### **5.3 Logical NOT (`!`)**
This operator inverts the value of a boolean. If the boolean is `true`, it will become `false` and vice versa.

**Example**: Check if a number is not zero.
```java  
int number = 5;  
  
if (! (number == 0)) {  
    System.out.println("The number is not zero.");  
} else {  
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");  
}  
```  
**Output**:
```  
The number is not zero.  
```  

### **6. Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)**

Apart from the `if-else` structure, Java also provides a shorthand way to perform conditional operations, which is the ternary operator `?:`.  
**Syntax**:
```java  
(condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;  
```  

**Example**: Find the largest of two numbers.
```java  
int a = 5, b = 7;  
  
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;  
System.out.println("The larger number is: " + max);  
```  
**Output**:
```  
The larger number is: 7  
```  

### **7. Important Points with Complex Scenarios**

- The condition inside the if or else if should always return a boolean value (true or false).
- Only one block among the if, else if, or else will get executed based on the first true condition.
- Parentheses () are mandatory after if and else if.
- Ensure your conditions are clear and readable. If you have many conditions or complex combinations, consider breaking them into multiple lines or using intermediary variables.
- Remember that Java uses short-circuit evaluation. This means that in a series of `&&` or `||` operators, as soon as one condition determines the result, the subsequent conditions won't be evaluated. For example, in the condition `(a != 0 && 10 / a > 1)`, if `a` is 0, the second condition will not be checked, preventing a division-by-zero error.
- The ternary operator is a concise way to handle simple conditional assignments. However, for more complex scenarios, the traditional `if-else` structure is more readable and maintainable.

# **Advanced Personal Tax Calculator**
## **Description:**
Develop a Java program that calculates the tax someone owes based on their income and other factors. Here's how the tax should be calculated:

- If the person's age is under 18 or over 60, they get a 10% discount on their tax.
- Base tax rate:
    - Income up to $20,000: 2%
    - Income between $20,001 and $40,000: 5%
    - Income between $40,001 and $80,000: 10%
    - Income over $80,001: 20%

- Additional factors:
    - If the person has more than 3 dependents, reduce the tax by 5%.
    - If the person is married, reduce the tax by 3%.

### _Input:_
```  
Age: 65  
Income: $55,000  
Dependents: 4  
Married: Yes  
```  

### _Output:_
```  
Total tax owed: $4,620  
```  
(Note: The above output is just an example. You'd need to use the provided rules to calculate the correct amount.)
