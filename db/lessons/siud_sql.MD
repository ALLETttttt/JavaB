Now that you know how to practice SQL online with SQLFiddle, let's move on to learning the key SQL statements.

### 1. SQL Essentials
**Introduction to SQL**:
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
- SQL allows you to query, insert, update, and delete data, as well as create and manage database structures.

### 2. Key SQL Statements
#### 2.1 SELECT Statement
- **Purpose**: Used to select data from a database.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```
- **Example**: Suppose we have a table `Students` with columns `StudentID`, `Name`, `Age`, and `Grade`.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Grade
  FROM Students;
  ```
- **Description**: This statement retrieves all records from the `Name` and `Grade` columns of the `Students` table.

#### 2.2 INSERT Statement
- **Purpose**: Used to insert new records into a table.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
  VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
  ```
- **Example**: To add a new student record:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Grade)
  VALUES (123, 'John Doe', 20, 'A');
  ```
- **Description**: This statement adds a new row to the `Students` table with the provided values.

#### 2.3 UPDATE Statement
- **Purpose**: Used to modify existing records in a table.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE table_name
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
  WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Example**: Updating the grade of a specific student:
  ```sql
  UPDATE Students
  SET Grade = 'B'
  WHERE StudentID = 123;
  ```
- **Description**: This statement updates the `Grade` of the student with `StudentID` 123 to 'B'.

#### 2.4 DELETE Statement
- **Purpose**: Used to delete existing records from a table.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Example**: Deleting a student record:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Students
  WHERE StudentID = 123;
  ```
- **Description**: This statement deletes the record of the student with `StudentID` 123 from the `Students` table.
