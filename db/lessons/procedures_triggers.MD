### Stored Procedures and Triggers
### 1. Stored Procedures in Java+DB (SQL)

**Definition and Use Cases:**
- Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements stored in a database. They are essential for encapsulating complex operations, enhancing performance, and ensuring data integrity.
- Ideal for complex transactions, where multiple SQL statements must be executed atomically. They are also used for encapsulating the business logic as part of the database layer.

**Real Business Cases:**
- **Data Aggregation:** In banking systems, a stored procedure might be used to calculate the monthly interest for all accounts.
- **Batch Processing:** In e-commerce, a stored procedure can handle bulk updates for product prices or inventory levels.
- **Data Validation:** Insurance applications often use stored procedures to validate policy information before insertion or updates.

**Calling Stored Procedures from Java:**
- Utilize JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API.
- Code snippet for calling a procedure:
  ```java
  Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
  CallableStatement statement = conn.prepareCall("{call procedureName(?, ?)}");
  statement.setString(1, "param1");
  statement.setInt(2, 100);
  ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
  // Handle ResultSet
  ```

### 2. Triggers
**Definition and Use Cases:**
- Triggers are automated procedures executed in response to specific events on a particular table or view in a database.
- They are useful for enforcing business rules, maintaining data integrity, and automatically updating related tables.

**Real Business Cases:**
- **Audit Logging:** In financial applications, triggers are used for maintaining audit logs. Any modification in transaction tables can automatically be logged for compliance and monitoring.
- **Automatic Notifications:** In CRM systems, triggers can notify account managers when their client data is updated or changed.
- **Data Integrity:** In healthcare systems, triggers ensure critical patient data is not inadvertently modified or deleted.

**Integration with Java:**
- Java applications can perform database operations (insert, update, delete) which in turn can activate triggers.
- While triggers operate at the database level, their effects (such as data changes or logging) are observed and handled by Java applications.

### Real Business Case Integration
- **Banking System:**
    - Stored Procedure: Automate the calculation of monthly interests or loan repayments.
    - Trigger: Detect and log any unauthorized access or modifications to sensitive customer data.
- **E-Commerce Platform:**
    - Stored Procedure: Bulk update of product prices based on seasonal offers or stock levels.
    - Trigger: Automatically update the inventory count when a new sale is registered.
- **Healthcare Application:**
    - Stored Procedure: Validate and process patient data before updating medical records.
    - Trigger: Create a backup of patient records before any critical updates.
